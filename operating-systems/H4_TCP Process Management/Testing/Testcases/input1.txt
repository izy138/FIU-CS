# Test Case 1: Valid Commands                                                              #
# This test verifies that your implementation correctly handles a mix of valid and invalid #
# commands, and continues execution without terminating prematurely.                       #
#                                                                                          #
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: Your TCP server implementation must use system() to execute commands  #
# received from the client. It should NOT capture or send the actual command output back   #
# to the client. Instead, it must only send status messages indicating whether the command #
# completed successfully or failed with an error code.                                     #
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Always succeeds
true

# Simple text output, highly portable
echo hello

# Always fails with exit status 1
false
