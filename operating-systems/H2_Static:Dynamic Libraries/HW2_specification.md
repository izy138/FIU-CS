<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; border-left: 6px solid #f7c948; padding: 12px; font-size: 12px;"> <strong>⚠️ Important: </strong>
    <span style="color:blue"> Please refer to the document <strong>📚 GUIDE – Creating Static and Shared (Dynamic) Libraries in C</strong>, available on the course page, for instructions on creating static libraries.</span>
---

## ☑️ Section 1: Assignment Overview

<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">To create a</span> <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">C static library</span> <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">containing mathematical utility functions. </span>

---

## ☑️ Section 2: Learning Objectives

- Static library creation and compilation in C
- Function implementation and modularization
- Understanding compilation and linking processes
- Library testing and validation

---

## ☑️ Section 3: Problem Description

You will implement mathematical utility functions in a C source file and compile them into a **static library** (`libmathutils.a`). The library will be tested using a provided driver program and testing framework.

---

## ☑️ Section 4: Provided Files Framework

**📖 Refer to these files** for understanding the exact requirements.

⚠️<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;"> Please do not make any modifications to the framework files provided.</span> You are required to implement **only** the skeleton file **`submission_HW2.c`**. Any changes to the framework files may result in errors during evaluation or loss of credit.

### Folder Structure

```bat
PROVIDED_FILES/
├── submission_HW2.c     # Template file (implement your solution here)
├── mathutils.h     	 # Header file (Do not modify!)
├── driver.c     		 # Driver code (Do not modify!)
├── Makefile             # Makefile (Do not modify!)
├── autograder_HW2.sh    # Testing script (Do not modify!)
└── Testing/ 			 # Testcases (Do not modify!)
    ├── Testcases/
    │   └── input1.txt   # Sample input data
    └── Expected_Output/
        └── output1.txt  # Expected output format
```

##  ☑️ Section 5: Developing and Testing Your Implementation

<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; border-left: 6px solid #f7c948; padding: 12px; font-size: 12px;">
  <span style="color: blue;">
    <strong>⚠️ DO NOT modify the following provided framework files:</strong>  
    <br> autograder_HW2.sh, mathutils.h, driver.c, Makefile, and the testcases.
  </span>
</div>
- **Implement your solution** in `submission_HW2.c`
- **Create your own static library from `submission_HW2.c` and name it** `libmathutils.a`.
  ⚠️ The library name **must match exactly** as specified.

### **Manual testing**:

Ensure the following files are located in the **same directory**, and then use the following commands in order:

- <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Your created static library</span>: **`libmathutils.a`**
- The provided driver code: **`driver.c`**
- The provided **`Makefile`** (used by the autograder)
- The provided header file: **`mathutils.h`**
- The provided testcase folder: **`Testing/`**

```bash
# Build your application executable with the provided Makefile
# The Makefile will produce an executabale `run`
make  

# Run the executable and redirect the output to a file:
./run > student_output.txt

# Compare your output with the expected output using the unix `diff` command:
diff student_output.txt output1.txt
```

- **Where:**

  - `make` → Makfile command to build your application
  - `run` → the executable generated by Makefile
  - `student_output.txt` → the file that stores the output produced by your program
  - `output1.txt` → the expected output file (provided under test cases)
  - `diff` → a Unix command used to compare the contents of two files

  <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;"> If there are no differences, the `diff` command will produce no output.</span> Any mismatches will be displayed line by line.

### **Autograder testing**:

Ensure the following files are located in the **same directory**, and then run the autograder:

- <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Your created static library</span>: **`libmathutils.a`**
- The provided driver code: **`driver.c`**
- The provided **Makefile** (used by the autograder)
- The provided header file: **`mathutils.h`**
- The provided testcase folder: **`Testing/`**
- The provided autograder script: **`autograder_HW2.sh`** 

```
./autograder_HW2.sh
```

- **Check your grade** and fix any issues


- **Repeat until** you achieve the desired score

### Testing requirements:

- **⚠️ MUST test on ocelot server**: `ocelot-bbhatkal.aul.fiu.edu`


- **⚠️ Test thoroughly before submission** - no excuses accepted
- ⚠️**"<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Works on my computer</span>" is NOT accepted** as an excuse
- ✅ <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;"> If you pass all test cases on the server, you will likely pass instructor's final grading</span>
- **✅ What you see is what you get** - autograder results predict your final grade

## ☑️ Section 6: Submission Requirements

### File Requirements  (⚠️ <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">exact names required</span>)
- **submission_HW2.c**: Your complete implementation
- **libmathutils.a**: Build configuration
- **README.txt or README.pdf**: Student information and documentation

  - Your README **⚠️ MUST include**:

  ```markdown
  # Student Information
  - Full Name: [Your Full Name]
  - PID: [Your FIU Panther ID]
  - Section: [Your Course Section]
  - FIU Email: [Your @fiu.edu email]
  
  # Homework: Static Library Creation
  [Brief description of your implementation approach]
  ```


### Deliverables`ZIP` File Submission
<div style="background-color: #fff8c4; border-left: 6px solid #f7c948; padding: 12px; font-size: 12px;">
  <span style="color: blue;">
    <strong>⚠️ DO NOT submit any other files other that these required files.The autograder may treat any additional items in the ZIP file as invalid, which will result in a grade of zero:</strong>
       submission_HW2.c, libmathutils.a, README <br><br> 👍All other required framework files and the testcases will be supplied by the instructor to the autograder during final grading. 

- ⚠️ You are required to submit your work as <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">**a single ZIP archive file**</span>
- **⚠️ Filename Format**: your <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">`Firstname_Lastname.zip`</span> (**exact format required**)
- **📁 Contents**: 
  - `submission_HW2.c`
  - `libmathutils.a`
  - `README`

```bat
Harry_Potter.zip
├── submission_HW2.c   # Your implementation
├── libmathutils.a	   # Your static library
└── README			   # Your details and brief implementation approach
```

## ☑️ Section 7: Grading Criteria

### 🤖 Autograder Testing
- ⚠️ Your static library `libmathutils.a` will be tested against the provided test cases as well as additional instructor test cases using the autograder.
- **⚠️ Exact output matching required** - any deviation results in point deduction
- **⚠️ Program must compile** without errors or warnings

### ⛔ Penalties
- **⚠️ Missing README**:<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;"> **-10 points**</span>
- **⚠️ Missing `submission_HW2.c`**:  <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">ZERO grade</span> (autograder compilation failure)
- **⚠️ Missing `libmathutils.a`**:  <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">ZERO grade</span> (autograder compilation failure)
- **⚠️ Incorrect ZIP filename**:  <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">ZERO grade</span> (autograder compilation failure)
- **Wrong source filename**: **⚠️ ZERO grade** (autograder compilation failure)
- **Late submission**: <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;"> NOT ALLOWED</span>

## ☑️ Section 8: Academic Integrity

- **👤 This is an individual assignment**
- **💬 You may discuss concepts** but not share code
- **📝 All submitted code** must be your original work
- ⚠️ **Plagiarism** is a serious offense and will result in penalties.
