Second Chance (Clock) Page Replacement Algorithm
----------------------------------------------
Page 7 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 7  _  _ ]
Page 0 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 7  0  _ ]
Page 1 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 7  0  1 ]
Page 2 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 2  0  1 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 2  0  1 ]
Page 3 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 2  0  3 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 2  0  3 ]
Page 2 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 2  0  3 ]
