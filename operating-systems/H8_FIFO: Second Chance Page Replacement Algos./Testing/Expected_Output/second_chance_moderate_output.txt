Second Chance (Clock) Page Replacement Algorithm
----------------------------------------------
Page 7 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 7  _  _  _ ]
Page 0 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 7  0  _  _ ]
Page 1 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 7  0  1  _ ]
Page 2 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 7  0  1  2 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 7  0  1  2 ]
Page 3 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 3  0  1  2 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 3  0  1  2 ]
Page 4 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 3  0  4  2 ]
Page 2 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 3  0  4  2 ]
Page 3 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 3  0  4  2 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 3  0  4  2 ]
