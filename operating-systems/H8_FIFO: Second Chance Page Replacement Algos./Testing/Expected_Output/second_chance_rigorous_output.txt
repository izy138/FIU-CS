Second Chance (Clock) Page Replacement Algorithm
----------------------------------------------
Page 1 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 1  _  _ ]
Page 0 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 1  0  _ ]
Page 7 loaded into empty frame. Frames: [ 1  0  7 ]
Page 1 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 1  0  7 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 1  0  7 ]
Page 2 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 2  0  7 ]
Page 1 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 2  1  7 ]
Page 2 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 2  1  7 ]
Page 3 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 2  1  3 ]
Page 0 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 0  1  3 ]
Page 3 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 0  1  3 ]
Page 2 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 0  2  3 ]
Page 4 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 0  2  4 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 0  2  4 ]
Page 3 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 0  3  4 ]
Page 0 already in memory. Reference bit set. Frames: [ 0  3  4 ]
Page 2 replaces page with reference bit 0. Frames: [ 0  3  2 ]
